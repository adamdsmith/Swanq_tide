bell_island.csv includes "good" data, meaning (1) data collected from 2014/02/09 - 2014/07/15 was not calibrated correctly and is excluded and (2) extreme data points (i.e., a single water level sample that differed by more than 0.5 m from the previous and subsequent water level) were deleted.  

NAVD88 elevation of water surface (m) calculated by adding the depth of the water column to the calculated elevation of the bolt in the bottom of the pipe. This elevation was derived by averaging the elevation of the top of the PVC pipe acquired from the survey data pre- and post-deployment and subtracting the measured length of the pipe.  Beginning in Sep 2015, a measuring point was added to the PVC pipe to ensure that the same point is surveyed on repeat visits.
